** This is some notes I've made while coding along. 

1. Initial videos show how to setup the structure. Initially, everything will be div and we replace one by one with component
2. In video 159, he shows how to convert JS object to array. I've modified a little bit but the concept is same.
  * Doubt I have in this concept of conversion : He uses [...Array(some length)].map(........)
  * Here I see [...Array(lenght)] creates [-,-,-] empty spaces and maps though this, fills the spaces with content and 
    then returns it. But I tried doing - new Array(length).map() and it didn't work. But I see even this creates 
    empty spaces like this [-,-,-].  I will answer this below if I find it.
Commit (0cf0fa5) - added functionality to convert object to array in burger to pass it tâ€¦
3. In video 160, in the process of flattening the array, I used .flat() but he used reduce function. Both are right, but learn this, it might be useful.
4. To know a bit about css flexbox - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSnc
   Flex box is best way to design grid css. 
5. Now we are building BuildControls (which includes BuildControl) component.

To summarize workflow till here: 

Set 1 Workflow as follows:

* Project structure created with create-react-app
* Added font (open-sans)
* Created components and containers folders
* Layout was created and App component holds Layout
* Inside Layout we now should have 
  a. Toolbar, SideDrawer, Backdrop, Logo and NavigationItems
  b. BurgerBuilder
     b.1 BurgerBuilder should have Burger
          -> Burger will have BurgerIngredients
            -> BurgerIngredients will have individual BurgerIngredient
     b.2 BuildControls
          -> BuildControls will have individual BuildControl

Note : So far we have done till BuildControls (UI Of BuildControls). v0.1 tag in git starts from BuildControls
Next we will hookup BuildControls to state (video 163 - Connecting State to BuildControls)
         
6. Added (My way to connect the state to BuildControls), and also disabled 'Less' btn if the ingredients are 0
