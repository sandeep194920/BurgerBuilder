## BurgerBuilder Project Overview

This project is built with react 16.12.0 and deployed to firebase. It is a complete project built using all basic possible libraries given below. It  has authentication (Login and Registration features), routing and a redux central store. In the src folder, I've added a file called Important notes in which, for each commit, I have written the steps taken to build each and every feature. This might be helpful for anyone who would like to build the project step by step by looking the commits.
